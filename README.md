# cnn-rnn-model-py
A custom CNN-RNN model built off Tensorflow using Python. The model was created to detect a sequence of body movements and identify them according to the annotated labels.
The body movement data was tracked and recorded using OpenPose and used here. The data format is indicated in the readme.txt in the data folder.

Features:
1. Keras API
2. Combination of MobileNetV2 and Bidirectional LSTM
4. Feed Forward Network
5. Video Frame Generator
6. Frame Sampling
7. Data Loader
8. JSON Label Splitter
10. Evaluation Metrics
