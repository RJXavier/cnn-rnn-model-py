About the Model
1. The model was created to detect a sequence of body movements from video and identify them according to the annotated labels.
2. The body movement data was tracked and recorded using OpenPose and used here. The data format is indicated in the readme.txt in the data folder.
3. Arrange your data according to the format given.
4. All the components and libraries used in this project is included in the requirements.txt file.
5. Download all the required python libraries.
6. Change all the folder paths in the required files.
7. Run models.py 
8. Unfortunately the dataset and the labelling scripts cannot be provided as they are our private property.
